            A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than researchers thought. 
            NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale crater for more than eight years, and
             while early observations suggested the entire crater may once have been filled with 
             water, a new analysis implies that it just had a series of ponds instead.
            Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a measure called the 
            chemical index of alteration to determine how rocks were weathered over time. Joseph 
            Michalski at the University of Hong Kong and his colleagues have suggested that because
             this measure was developed for use on Earth, it may not be valid in the extreme Martian
             climate.
            Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds that are expected to 
            change based on different types of weathering over time. They found that some of the 
            layers of rock Curiosity examined did interact with water at some point in their past,
             but more are likely to have formed outside of the water.

             “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers that are demonstrably
              lacustrine [formed in a lake] are the lower few metres,” says Michalski. 
              “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is
               something like 1 per cent.”

             These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of sediments in the crater, 
             suggesting the lake was not nearly as deep or extensive as we thought. “There was 
             likely a small lake or more likely a series of small lakes in the floor of Gale crater,
              but these were shallow ponds,” says Michalski.
             
             The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so Michalski says that 
             they may have formed out of ash from volcanic eruptions after the water in Gale crater
              had dried up. Observations by other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments 
              were deposited by wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.<br>
